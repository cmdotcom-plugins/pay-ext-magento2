## Payment methods
### Fetch payment methods by order

The CM.com API requires an order to retrieve all the payment methods, to accomplish this in the Magento checkout this module creates a temporary order based on the Magento quote. These temporary orders will always have a 'Q_' prefix. 

## Payment method configuration
### General

Each payment method is configurable in Magento. There are a few default settings: 
- Enabled
- Title
- Applicable countries
- Applicable currencies
- Minimum order total
- Maximum order total
- Sort order

**Note** The payment methods will only visible if they enabled in both Magento and the CM.com Portal. 

### CM.com redirect to Menu

This payment method redirects to the CM.com payment menu. In the payment menu you will see all available payment methods as configured in the CM.com Portal.

### iDEAL

This method shows the bank issuers in the Magento checkout and redirects directly to the selected issuer. 

### Paypal

This method directly redirects to the Paypal payment page.

### ELV

ELV (Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren) is a payment method used mainly in Germany.
This method directly redirects to the ELV payment page.

### Klarna

This method directly redirects to the Klarna payment page. Klarna requires a birthdate of the shopper which is requested in the Magento checkout.

### Creditcard

All the 'Creditcard' payment methods are mapped under one Magento payment method called `cm_payments_creditcard`
This includes the following CM.com payment methods:
`VISA`
`MASTERCARD`
`MAESTRO`

**Configuration**

The creditcard payment redirects to the CM.com payment menu. It's recommended to create a separate 'Creditcard' payment profile in the CM.com portal to show only the credit card methods in the CM.com payment menu.

### BanContact

The BanContact payment redirects to the CM.com payment menu. It's recommended to create a separate 'BanContact' payment profile in the CM.com portal to show only the BanContact method in the CM.com payment menu.

### Afterpay

The BanContact payment redirects to the CM.com payment menu. It's recommended to create a separate 'Afterpay' payment profile in the CM.com portal to show only the Afterpay method in the CM.com payment menu.

## Webhook
In order to get status updates from CM.com it's required to configure a webhook in the CM.com portal.
The url for this webhook is: `{{shop_url}}/cmpayments/payment/notification?id={{increment_id}}`
